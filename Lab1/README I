Lab 1 consists of Map of Real world and simulation world.

In Real folder we have uploaded map as png file and rivz file. We have created map of our class room. 

In Simulation folder we have uploaded map of virtual house which is created in gazebo and uploaded png file and rviz file.

Steps to create map in Simulation :

1)Go to Docker folder
2)Run command bash run_docker.sh, which is used to run the docker
3)open new terminal,run command bash into_docker.sh inside the docker folder then you will enter inside docker container
4) After entering into the Docker container run the command to create virtual environment in gazebo which is a 3d simulator 
	4.1)command to create house in gazebo is roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_house.launch
	4.2)command to create world in gazebo is roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch
 we have created a house environment using 4.1 command 
5) After that open another terminal and get into docker and run the command to operate turtlebot with our keyboard
	5.1)command to operate turtlebot with keyboard is roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
 after running this you can operate robot with keyboard keys.
 6)open new terminal and enter into docker then run below command to launch slam mode
 	6.1)roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch
 7)create map moving inside the house using keyboard keys and save the file.
 
 Steps tp create map in real world:

 1) Make sure robot & PC are in the same Network 
 2) follow 1 to 3 steps from simualtions to enter into docker container
 3)Run command gedit ~/.bashrc then a textfile will pop upand at the end add below two lines
 export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://{IP_ADDRESS_OF_REMOTE_PC}:11311 
 export ROS_HOSTNAME={IP_ADDRESS_OF_RASPBERRY_PI_3}
 4)Write both PC adress and Raspberry pi adress in dedicated places
 5)save File and source it by running the following command source ~/.bashrc 
 6)open new terminal and run roscore 
 7)open new terminal and connect to robot using this command ssh ubuntu@IP adress of Raspberry pi
 8)Enter password (turtlebot) for us
 9)Run bringup command roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch and  wait until calibration end 
 10)follow steps from simulations to run teleoperation command after running that use keys to move robot and procedure to launch slam(follow steps from 5 to 7)
